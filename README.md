# weather-dashboard

## Description

I created this project in order to see the current and future weather outlook of multiple cities. This app allows a user to see their search history and input new cities to be searched on one page. Throughout creating this project, I learned how to utilize server-side APIs. I also learned to how create my own API key and how to use the fetch API to read and play with data.

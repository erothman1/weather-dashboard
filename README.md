# weather-dashboard

## Description

I created this project in order to see the current and future weather outlook of multiple cities. This app allows a user to see their search history and input new cities to be searched on one page. Throughout creating this project, I learned how to utilize server-side APIs. I also learned to how create my own API key and how to use the fetch API to read and play with data.

## Usage

To use this application, type in a city comma country-code such as "Austin, US" or "New York, US". Once the that is typed in, press search and the current weather and five-day forecast will come up! You're search history will come up as buttons that you can click as well.
